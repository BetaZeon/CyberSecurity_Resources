# Upgrading MISP

!!! note
    As time goes by this space will be populated with certain upgrade specific tasks that might at the time of this writing still be in the [MISP-book](https://www.circl.lu/doc/misp/)

!!! warning
    If you are a MISP developer reading this.<br />
    Always aim to avoid having to write anything about a specific upgrade procedure. We strive to make our upgrades as seamless as possible and no extra steps should be needed, alas, extreme circumstances sometimes need those extreme measures.<br />
    We have been warned.
