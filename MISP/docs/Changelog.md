------------------------

New
---
- [doc] Support request template (#5420) [Steve Clement]

  new: [doc] Support request template
- [doc] Support request template. [Steve Clement]
- [deprecation] Added a new library to handle deprecations. [iglocska]

  - send X-Deprecation-Warning via the API
  - set new Warning flash messages via the UI
  - counting the use of these functionalities / API endpoint and / user
    - added a diagnsitic tool to view the outcome of the collection
    - sharing of these collections with the MISP-Project will be optionally available in the future

  - two modes of operation:
    - hard deprecation (functions certainly to be removed, reported to the users via API/UI)
    - soft deprecation (gauging interest for the continued use of these functions)
- [sql diagnostics] Started work on a system to automatically generate
  scripts to fix issues. [iglocska]

  - currently somewhat limited
  - requires additional input to generate correct queries, needs an update for the default schemas
  - generated, but not exposed for now
- [sync] view remote user tool added to the server index. [iglocska]

  - should help with debugging what user is being used
- [API] Added attribute_timestamp flag to attributes/restSearch.
  [iglocska]

  Explanation of the 4 timestamp filters:
  timestamp: Filters on attribute AND event timestamp
  event_timestamp: Filters on event timestamp
  attribute_timestamp: Filters on attribute timestamp
  publish_timestamp: Filters on event.publish_timestamp
- [UI] formInfo element added to the form generator. [iglocska]
- [API] SQL dump now includes two modes. [iglocska]

  - sql_dump:1 - append the SQL dump to the response
  - sql_dump:2 - only return the SQL dump in the response
- [API] Cleaner API debugging via the API. [iglocska]

  - passing sql:1 as a url parameter will try to add the sql_dump key to the response if SQL debugging is enabled
  - allows for the easier debugging of for example search queries

  Minor visual bug in event view
- Minor visual bug in event view. [Davide Baglieri]

  Creating a new event with no attributes the "First recorded change" value displayed is "1970-01-01 01:00:00".

  ![MISP_Event](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidonzo/host/master/misp_loves_70s_me_too.png)

  This is quite normal looking at the php code in "app/Controller/EventsController.php" from line 1277 to 1289
  ```
  $oldest_timestamp = false;
          if (!empty($event['Object'])) {
              foreach ($event['Object'] as $k => $object) {
                  if (!empty($object['Attribute'])) {
                      foreach ($object['Attribute'] as $attribute) {
                          if ($oldest_timestamp == false || $oldest_timestamp < $attribute['timestamp']) {
                              $oldest_timestamp = $attribute['timestamp'];
                          }
                      }
                      $attributeCount += count($object['Attribute']);
                  }
              }
          }
  ```
  Since no attributes/objects are added to the event $oldest_timestamp will always be false.
  It's just a little visual bug. So my pragmatic solution was change line 200 in "app/view/Events/view.ctp from

  ```'value' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $oldest_timestamp)```

  to

  ```'value' => (!$oldest_timestamp) ? '' : date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $oldest_timestamp)```

  [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  Thanks to @stamparm for the idea during the Cyber Exchange program
- [AppController] move debugMode setup code to a function so it can be
  reused. [Andreas Rammhold]

  There were already two places in AppComponent that implemented the same
  functionality. It makes sense to move this to a common function so it
  can also be used from Controllers that do not inherit the full
  beforeFilter functionality.

  Since `__preAuthException` is private and only called from the
  beforeFilter method after the variable has been setup we can remove
  the explicit init from there.
- [AppController] move the database connection setup to a dedicated
  function on the AppComponent. [Andreas Rammhold]

  This removes a bit of clutter from the already large beforeFilter
  method and allows other views to resuse the logic without having to
  duplicate it.
- [AppController] move the `baseurl` configuration into a helper method.
  [Andreas Rammhold]

  This makes the beforeFilter function a bit smaller while keeping all the
  functionality. It will also help with reusing the setup logic in views
  that can not execute all of AppComponent::beforeFilter, like the
  LinOTPAuth plugin.
- [AppController] move loading and initialisation of Auth plugins to
  reuseable method. [Andreas Rammhold]

  For some authentication workflows it might be desireable to execute the
  exact same code without having to call the entire beforeFilter method
  from the base class. That way you do not have to work around all the
  edge cases without having to reinvent the same code in multiple
  locations.
- [AppController] move login redirects to dedicated functions. [Andreas
  Rammhold]

  This makes it easier to modify the login redirect behaviour in a unified
  way. For now this just uses the default Auth loginAction while setting
  the `admin` attribute to `false`. Thus application behaviour should be
  unchanged.
- [PyMISP] latest version. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- [stix2 export] Better vulnerability object parsing. [chrisr3d]

Fix
---
- [PyMISP] Travis tests. [Raphaël Vinot]

- [missing] component added. [iglocska]
- [UI] Show advanced and SG input when page is reload. [Jakub Onderka]
- [AttributesController] Fix issues related to undefined variables.
  [Pierre-Jean Grenier]
- [hover enrichment] Fixed variable name that caused issues with hover
  enrichment for more than 1 module called on 1 single attribute.
  [chrisr3d]
- [stix export] Typo. [chrisr3d]
- [internal] Set attribute restsearch page to 1 if limit is set without
  setting the page number. [iglocska]
- [UI] Linebreak between global/public tag add buttons on the attribute
  list fixed. [iglocska]

  - was driving me nuts
- [UI] Removed unused JS variable. [Jakub Onderka]
- [API] massive performance boost for large events with many
  correlations. [iglocska]

  - the logic of the JSON converter was heavy and unnecesary
- [UI] Do not show Advanced extraction when not possible. [Jakub
  Onderka]
- [sightings] Fix undefined variable with REST search. [Pierre-Jean
  Grenier]
- [internal] massive performance boost when loading events with a lot of
  objects. [iglocska]

- [internal] Correct error handling for invalid taxonomies. [Jakub
  Onderka]
- Undefined variable when no feed was enable. [Pierre-Jean Grenier]
- [feed] fix REST problems. [Pierre-Jean Grenier]
- [feed] array from NULL is not NULL. [Pierre-Jean Grenier]
- [UI] Error handling for submitPopoverForm function. [Jakub Onderka]
- [performance] Small speed boost to the publishing process. [iglocska]

  - don't fetch the event's first degree relations when preparing to publish it
- [performance] notifications lookup on each UI page load was slow.
  [iglocska]

  - introduced a major bottleneck on large instances

- [performance] notifications lookup on each UI page load was slow.
  [iglocska]

  - introduced a major bottleneck on large instances
  - massively reduced the load times for pages that warranted none
- [mysql.sql] typo resolved. [iglocska]
- [user_settings] added timestamp field. [iglocska]
- [internal] removed debug calls. [iglocska]
- [debug] Removed internal breakpoint that was left in. [iglocska]
- [correlation] Skip correlation on tasks that modify an attribute in a
  way that wouldn't warrant a recorrelation, fixes #5204. [iglocska]

  - Only recorrelate attribute if:
    - attribute is new
    - attribute already exists and value, disable_correlation, type is updated
- [API] proposals overriding attributes wasn't always working as
  expected, fixes #4032. [iglocska]

  - until now it was bound to the to_ids setting (badly) which caused nothing but headache
  - moved the new configuration to instead use the non-permissive nature of the given export formats

  - non-permissive export: if the proposal block is enabled, override attributes
  - permissive export types: ignore the proposals

  The reasoning is simple: we use the permissive export types for types that can express additional structures such as proposals, IDS flags, publish flags etc (meaning the MISP JSON/XML formats for example)
- [user setting] Left off missing changes to the controller. [iglocska]
- [logging] paranoid log entry not logging request body via the API.

    checked AND the user has the right to publish
- [stix 1/2 import] Avoid adding the original stix file in the event if
  the option is not checked. [chrisr3d]
- [stix 1/2 import] Adding misp event json data within the 'Event' field
  if it is not already in. [chrisr3d]
- [internal] paranoid log body didn't contain full body for API calls.
  [iglocska]
- [stix 1/2 restSearch] Deleting temporary files in case of an error in
  the python side. [chrisr3d]

  types. [chrisr3d]

- [sfv] Fix checksums. [Steve Clement]
- [community access requests] fixed serveral issues, fixes #5194.
  [iglocska]

  - added missing view to preview the request

---------------------

New
---
- [API] get a single server setting via
  /servers/getSetting/[setting_name], fixes #4964. [iglocska]
- [API] Allow posting freetext data for ingestion via the event uuid
  instead of ID, fixes #4995. [iglocska]

- [sync] Added a protection from receiving empty published events from
  other instances. [iglocska]

  - a temporary solution to some older, bugged instances emitting them

- Bumped query version. [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment] Import modules now support new modules format. [chrisr3d]

  - Import module results are sent to the new view
    (same as for expansion modules) whenever they
    support objects import
  - Function handling the results right after they
    are returned from the module has also been moved
    to Model/Event and is used for both expansion &
    import modules
- [enrichment] Making attributes category & type changeable. [chrisr3d]

  - To keep possibility to select the attribute type
    or category, as it is in freetext import
  - Category and Type values that can be selected by
    users should be specified in the results, using
    an array. Otherwise, they are set and cannot be
    changed in the view (as it is the case for the
    other fields like value and uuid)
  - This feature is only applicable on attributes
    level, and not on object attributes level
- [enrichment] Passing the initial object to the form. [chrisr3d]

  - If the attribute we query the module on is an
    object attribute, we want to have this object
    information se we do not add or overwrite
    attributes already here
- [ObjectReference] Referenced id, uuid & type set now from a function
  that could be reused. [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment] Defined function to appy inflector on strings. [chrisr3d]

  So we can use it each time we want to display the
  freetext import / module results status message

- [stix2 export] Fixed user account pattern creation. [chrisr3d]
- [stix2 export] Fixed user account observable extension. [chrisr3d]
- [galaxies] several minor issues fixed in the UI. [iglocska]
- [CLI] admin->setDatabaseVersion fixed. [iglocska]
- [discussions] Fix to a potential black-hole inducing issue. [iglocska]

  - this totally won't do anything
- [tmpdir] fixed invalid file path. [iglocska]
- [UI] Fixed erroneous tag add buttons from the index. [iglocska]
- [internal] upload sample had a hard coded tmp path that would fail to
  the php fallback if MISP is not installed in /var/www/MISP. [iglocska]
- [stix2 import] Quick variable simplification. [chrisr3d]
- [stix2 import] Reusing functions to simplify the code & avoid
  duplicates. [chrisr3d]
- [stix2 import] Fixed network socket values from pattern. [chrisr3d]
- [stix import] Fixed backward compatibility of an exception. [chrisr3d]
- [eventGraph] Correctly pick the first-matching requiredOneOff to
  generate the object's label. [mokaddem]
- [enrichment] Avoiding issues with failing references. [chrisr3d]

  - In our case of handling module results, we don't
    especially want the results parsing to stop
    because of a missing/failing reference, we just
    want to skip it
- [events] Create massive dummy events. [mokaddem]
- [enrichment] Fixed meta-category fetching. [chrisr3d]

  - Due to the javascript part, we need to set a
    'meta_category' field, which we then translate
    to the expected 'meta-category' field, but which
    is not required when enrichment is called from
    the event level
- [installer] Variable regression (#4829) [Steve Clement]

- [modules] Added full attribute to full event enrichment's module
  query. [iglocska]
- [stix2 import] Fixed socket extension parsing + reusing code.
  [chrisr3d]

  - Reusing the function defined to avoid duplicates
    for network socket objects generated via the
    MISP to STIX2 export
- [stix2 import] Replacing unnecessary defaultdict by dict. [chrisr3d]
- [stix2 import] Reusing function & avoiding duplicates. [chrisr3d]
- [stix2 export] Making stix2-validator happy with email additional
  header fields. [chrisr3d]
- [stix2 export] Making stix2-validator happpy with registry key
  patterns. [chrisr3d]
- [internal] processing freetext data without background workers fixed.
  [iglocska]
- [enrichment view] Testing if event metadata elements exist before
  displaying them. [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment] Applying regular expressions to values before displaying
  them. [chrisr3d]

  - So when the DB is queried to find if object
    attributes with those values already exist,
    we do not miss some stored values
- [enrichment] Strengthened query conditions to find existing object
  attributes. [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment view] Displaying Tags only if not empty (error otherwise)
  [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment] Added missing variable. [chrisr3d]
- Returning tags & galaxies from module results. [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment view] Fixed attributes display wwwwwwwwwww. [chrisr3d]

  - Making attribute value display accept to be on
    multilines to let more space for uuids to be on
    1 line
  - This makes the global display lighter with long
    attribute values, because they were displayed on
    only 1 line, making uuids displayed on 3 or 4
    lines, making the complete view height way bigger
    than expected
- [enrichment view] Displaying forgotten header when there is no object
  in module results. [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment] Setting importComment value before going to the view.
  [chrisr3d]

  - Saving a variable & will avoid issues when reusing
    the view for import modules
- [enrichment] Json format of validation errors. [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment view] Fixed mispositioned closing tags. [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment] Fixed tags classes names following the latest changes on
  the module results view. [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment view] Using some MISP event view parts. [chrisr3d]

  - Using the same design as objects and attributes as in
    the MISP event view
- [enrichment] Fixed change on types & categories. [chrisr3d]

  ... that should be applied on attributes level and
  not on object attributes level
- [enrichment] Removing traces of some variables related to the freetext
  import. [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment] Removed possibility to display freetext result in the new
  module results view. [chrisr3d]
- [hover enrichment] Displaying information of empty results when
  needed. [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment] Displaying reference saving errors in the job status.
  [chrisr3d]

  - Finaly using the dedicated list to display
    validation errors for references
- [enrichment] Better references handling. [chrisr3d]

  - References are all handled at the end, after the
    attributes and objects are all saved (or skipped
    when needed).
  - Since we no longer have any data in '$failed',
    we simply skip every reference related to uuids
    present in this list.
  - '$recovered_uuids' is the list used to handle
    uuids of resolved attributes/objects already
    in the event.
  - We also skip references already present in the
    event (i.e same source, same target and same
    relationship type).
- [enrichment] Better resolved objects handling. [chrisr3d]

  - We handle the initial object independently from
    all the other objects.
  - We make sure Object attributes are not already
    in the event (i.e the object is not already in
    the event) before saving it
  - Some other cases handled a better way to make
    sure we skip saving object attributes or
    references when they should not be, or to skip
    what should be skipped.
- [enrichment] Redefinition of the '$failed' array. [chrisr3d]

  - Used as list and not as dict
  - Used to keep a list of failing attribute & objects
  - Attributes already present in the event are no
    longer saved in this list, and their uuid is saved
    in the '$recovered_uuids' list which is used to
    redirect the resolved attribute / object uuid to
    the same already present attribute / object
- [enrichment] Fixed inflector typo. [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment] Simplified tests if not empty. [chrisr3d]

  - In those specific cases, we can simply skip
    testing if something is set or equals 0, '' or
    false, since it is all implied in 'empty'
- [enrichment view] Quick change, using variable. [chrisr3d]

  ... Instead of going twice through the dictionary
  keys to fetch the same value
- [enrichment] Displaying error value in the job status instead of the
  json format. [chrisr3d]
- Removed test variables. [chrisr3d]

  - Also pardon my French
- [enrichment] Typo on Object references field relationship_type.
  [chrisr3d]

- [enrichment] Set sharing group id to 0 when distribution is not
  'Sharing Group' [chrisr3d]

  - Also setting some return data & fields
- [enrichment view] Added missing form fields + button typo. [chrisr3d]

  - Those form inputs are the ones that are used in
    the javascript part to submit results
- [enrichment view] Fixed Object sharing group field location.
  [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment view] Trying to avoid submit button to be somewhere not
  intended. [chrisr3d]
- [enrichment] Avoiding errors on distribution and sharing group data.
  [chrisr3d]

  - Making sure we do have a value for distribution
    and sharing group
  - Avoid translating distribution levels into their
    human meaning because the output process capturing
    data from the form will anyway use the numeric
    values. Readable values are btw displayed in the
    form for users confort
  - Also sanitized data displayed

  them. [chrisr3d]

- :construction: [enrichment] Handling the potential uuids differences. [chrisr3d]

  - We want to be sure the references we add to an
    event are pointing to the right target, so
    when an attribute/object is already in the event
    and is a reference target, we want to point to
    this already existing attribute/object, and not
    to the one we get from the module results, which
    will afterall be skipped.
  - Also to to that, attributes already in the event
    are simply not saved, but we need to find in the
    event if an event already exists or not, using
    its attributes
  - More care to the references themselves to come
- Merge branch '2.4' of https://github.com/MISP/MISP into
  rework_modules. [chrisr3d]
- :construction: [enrichment] Avoiding duplicate object attributes. [chrisr3d]

- :construction: [enrichment] Support of object references. [chrisr3d]

  - Handling the references between objects and
    attributes or objects that are displayed in the
    form and saving them.
  - Avoiding issue when an attribute or object can
    not be saved and is referenced: trying to find
    in the event if it is an attribute, returning
    a warning message if it is an object or if
    nothing corresponding to the failing referenced
    object or attribute is found.

  [iglocska]

  - org admins have the inherent ability to reset passwords for all of their org's users
  - this however could be abused if for some reason the host org of an instance would create org admins
    - the org admin could set a password manually for the site admin or simply use the API key of the site admin to impersonate them
  - the potential for abuse is very circumstancial as it requires the host org to create lower privilege org admins instead of the usual site admins
  - only org admins of the same organisation as the site admin could abuse this

  - as reported by Raymond Schippers

  include perm_tagger and perm_tag_editor(sync only) [iglocska]

  BERT]

  There is still much work to be done. But we are on the road.

  Ideally, and in order to avoid code dupplicates, we should have some utility functions to generate a proper and accessible yes/no icon, an accessible icon link, etc. This would prevent the code from being filled with "aria-label" tags, since the "title" and "aria-label" properties are nearly always the same.

  ### Work environment

  | Questions                 | Answers
  |---------------------------|--------------------
  | Type of issue             | Documentation Update
  | OS version (server)       | CentOS
  | OS version (client)       | Ubuntu, ...
  | PHP version               | 7.1
  | MISP version / git hash   | 2.4
  | Browser                   | If applicable

  ### Expected behavior
  Follow procedures to install, with no errors.

  ### Actual behavior
  Error to create ssl keys, while following procedures.
  The steps to create openssl private keys on line 335 point to file in /etc/pki/tls/certs/misp.local.key, while later in line 338 it looks for file in /etc/pki/tls/certs/misp.local.key.

  element in the confirm modal. [mokaddem]

  if a value was given to the key `values` instead of an array,
  the Model function `addSighting` would *crash* and skip the condition on
  the value, consequently adding a sighting on every attributes.
- [UI] Popover gets closed correctly if button clicked twice. reuse
  generated popover id instead of one-side generation. [mokaddem]

  Fixes issues like: Warning (2): count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable in [/var/www/MISP/app/Model/Server.php, line 2353]
- [UI] clarification of the istance owner organisation field on the
  servers/add view. [iglocska]
- [CSV] Fixed some defaults for the CSV export. [iglocska]
- [API] Fix non exportable tags being included in the attribute level
  restsearch. [iglocska]
- [API templates] Clarification about the serversettings API. [iglocska]
- Test for old school CSV download. [Raphaël Vinot]
- [install] Added pip3 installation before the venv installation.
  [Andras Iklody]
- [instructions] Added missing virtualenv dependency. [Andras Iklody]
- [tools] misp-restore.sh incorrectly validating 'BackupFile' from the
  command line. [Chris Ford]
- [API] CSV ignore flag restored to old behaviour. [iglocska]

  - if not set, only return published events / to_ids flagged events by default
  - setting ignore:0 will result in the default behaviour
  - setting ignore:1 will result in unpublished events and non to_ids attributes being filtered out
  - fixed a bug that broke the CSV api if ignore:0 was passed
- [sync] Fixed an issue preventing sharing group distributed data from
  being pushed. [iglocska]
- [objects] Fixes issue #3874. [iglocska]

  - shouldn't be allowed in the first place
- [admin/email] replaced hardcoded url into baseurl. [mokaddem]
- [users/emails] submission fix + cleaned code + comments. [mokaddem]
- [stix import] Fixed uuid fetching. [chrisr3d]
- [missing files] added missing templates. [iglocska]
- [attribute search] Fixed invalid JS calls introduced as part of the
  rework (:construction:) [iglocska]
- [api] Invalid handling of empty parameters in the built in parameter
  builder. [iglocska]
- [tags] showAttributeTag function now correctly culls galaxy tags.
  [iglocska]
- [stix import] Fixed Tags import. [chrisr3d]
- [stix export] Fixed dictionary update which requires lists and not
  tuples. [chrisr3d]
- [CLI] Fixed the CLI feed fetcher. [iglocska]

  - use "all" to fetch all feeds
- [sharing groups] Fixed several sharing group issues preventing proper
  editing of events with SGs. [iglocska]

  - include the uuid and modified time in the sharing group
  - fix the incorrectly embedded organisation object
- [API] better handling of trying to edit an attribute without
  permissions to do so. [iglocska]
- [stix2 import] Fixed relationship target uuid. [chrisr3d]
- [cleanup] Updated function names to differentiate observable parsing
  from the next updates on pattern parsing. [chrisr3d]
- [API] throw a proper error when trying to edit an event without access
  to doing so. [iglocska]
- [enrichment] linebreak woes. [iglocska]
- [enrichment] Adding proper linebreaks, cut 2. [iglocska]
- [cleanup] removed junk. [iglocska]
- [cleanup] Cleaned up STIX 1&2 export scripts. [chrisr3d]
- [stix2 import] Taking Relationship objects target_ref as uuid.
  [chrisr3d]

  - Better than using the Relationship id that is not
    going to be  represented in MISP
  - We directly have the uuid of the object that will
    receive an Object Reference
- Fixes attribute popup UI issues with expansion. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- [stix2 import] Excluding patterns with any of some linking words.
  [chrisr3d]

  - Since those patterns contain linking words we do
    not know how to map, we do not even try to parse
    them and only stix2-patterns will be created
    from them
- [stix 1&2 export] Making initiation lists immutable. [chrisr3d]

  - Lists only used for mapping should be immutable
    since they are not modified. Thus declaring as
    tuples is more appropriate
- [doc] Typo in index for Tsurugi Linux. [Steve Clement]
- [stix2 import] Better selection of objects to parse in object_refs.
  [chrisr3d]

  - It is not nececssary to call parsing functions on
    reports in object_refs because they are already
    parsed through the loop iterating through reports
- [stix2 import] Using Report attributes instead of dictionary keys.
  [chrisr3d]

  - Also improved the loop iterating through reports
- [stix2 import] Try-catching Report objects creator reference.
  [chrisr3d]
- \#3774 [restResponse] added missing `includeEventTags` entry.
  [mokaddem]
- [doc] Added note about WSGI issues on Ubuntu 16.04 chg: [doc]
  Changelog.md updated to latest. [Steve Clement]
- [doc] Included git repo of gitchangelog due to Python 3.7 bug fix not
  yet in release: https://github.com/vaab/gitchangelog/issues/107.
  [Steve Clement]
- Travis build. [Raphaël Vinot]
- [acl] bumped ACLComponent. [mokaddem]
- [stix export] Fixed function header missing self attribute. [chrisr3d]
- [stix import] Using standard error instead of standard output for
  missing types in mappings. [chrisr3d]
- [stix import] Related objects parsing. [chrisr3d]

  - Not only for observables as before, but also for
    observable objects in indicators
- [stix import] Using subclasses + Support of STIX coming from multiple
  MISP events. [chrisr3d]

  - Using subclasses here allowed us to simplify some
    variables declarations and to reuse some functions
  - STIX coming from multiple MISP events refers to
    STIX files created via the MISP to STIX export
    that can include multiple MISP events

- [stix import] Avoided import of empty header description. [chrisr3d]
- [galaxy] added collection uuid capture. [iglocska]
- [view] Added uuids to galaxy cluster view. [iglocska]
- [stix export] Avoided putting Incident object as attribute everywhere.
  [chrisr3d]

  - Incident is now a class attribute
  - It also let us make the function parsing some
    not really common attribute types lighter by
    putting a conditionnal statement in another
    function
- [stix export] Made 'header_comment' a list so we don't overwrite the
  value. [chrisr3d]

  - There should only be one attribute matching the
    condition per event, but it is juste to be sure
- [thumbnail] Thumbnail visualisation broken on proposals, fixes #3793.
  [iglocska]
- [server] Allow certificates to be uploaded with other extensions
  besides .pem, fixes #3797. [iglocska]

  - As reported by @eCrimeLabs
- [internal] Unneeded model initialisation for
  getDefaultAttachments_dir() [iglocska]
- [stix2 import] Fixed GalaxyCluster description. [chrisr3d]

  - Since description is optionnal in some STIX 2.0
    objects, we test if the field is there before
    trying to use its value
- [stix2 import] Fixed MISP event info field when importing STIX2
  without report object. [chrisr3d]

- [tools] small typo in she-bang line. [Steve Clement]
- [stix2 import] Made NetworkTraffic objects import include all the
  possible cases. [chrisr3d]

  - We were potentially missing some DomainName
    or IP Address objects data, when it is not
    a reference of the NetworkTraffic object.
  - Now we look if we still have some of these
    objects that did not have been parsed, and
    in that case, parse them.
- [stix2 import] Quick change on event loading. [chrisr3d]

  - Specifying the encoding within the file opening
  - Allows to get rid of 1 'encode()' call
- [stix2 import] Better parsing for objects that can be imported as
  either ip-port or network-socket. [chrisr3d]
- [stix2 import] Supporting STIX 2 files with no report object.
  [chrisr3d]
- [stix2 import] Moved the remaining parsing functions from the mapping
  script to the main script. [chrisr3d]

  - Fixing at the same time some AttributeName errors
- [stix2 export] Fixed enumeration errors handling. [chrisr3d]

  - More specific exception types
  - Removed useless try/catch statement
- [stix2 export] Fixed attributes data parsing. [chrisr3d]

  - With json format, base64 & encode/decode
    operations are no longer needed since the base64
    string is already displayed in data
- [stix2 import] Fixed process import. [chrisr3d]

  Features to be merged:
  - Export of multiple MISP events
  - Fetching events and writing them into files, each
    file containing at most a number of attributes
    defined by a limit

    event individualy, which reduces the number of
    times the python scripts are called, reducing
    the execution time of the overall process
  - The result is then returned as on single file
    read and displayed

  Fix broken timestamps by using 24 hour clock and ISO 8601 date format
- Fix broken timestamps by using 24 hour clock and ISO 8601 date format.
  [Daniel Roethlisberger]

  The event view shows a wrong "Last change", e.g. "2018/08/23 06:01:45"
  for "2018/08/23 18:01:45".  The same problem affects the timestamp in
  the XML generated by IOCExportTool.php.  Fix by correcting the PHP
  date() code "h" to "H".

  While here, also switch to a clearer ISO 8601 date representation for
  "Last change", using dashes instead of slashes for separation of year,
  month and day.

    - extensions: list of dictionaries with existing extensions created by the user's org (containing the id, uuid, info fields)

  - The algorithms implementing this should prioritise as such:

  2. If no, check if extensions exist - if yes, edit one of those
  3. If no, create a new extension to the original event
- [sync] Added flag to avoid using the proxy. [iglocska]

- Batch delete should hard delete if event hasn't been published yet,
  fixes #3311. [iglocska]
- [API] objects/add now supports uuids and the version number.
  [iglocska]

  - API: /objects/add/[template_id]/[version]
    - template_id can be a UUID
    - version is an optional parameter to select the specific version of a template if searching by uuid
- Hard delete attributes when event was never published, fixes #3311.
  [iglocska]

- New APIs to add/remove orgs and servers from sharing groups, fixes
  #2888. [iglocska]

  - added functions to manage the additions/removals of objects from sharing groups
  - the following APIs are included:
    - /sharingGroups/addOrg/[sg_id]/[org_id]/[extend]
    - /sharingGroups/removeOrg/[sg_id]/[org_id]
    - /sharingGroups/addServer/[sg_id]/[server_id]/[all_orgs]
    - /sharingGroups/removeServer/[sg_id]/[server_id]

  - All parameters are optional and can instead be passed as JSON objects such as:

    {
      "org_uuid": "55f6ea5e-2c60-40e5-964f-47a8950d210f",
      "sg_id": "49",
      "extend": 1
    }

  - The API is extremely flexible with how to name objects, the following parameters are allowed:
    - Organisations:
      - org_id (The organisation's local instance ID)
      - org_uuid (The organisation's global UUID)
      - org_name (The organisation's identifier as known to the curent instance)
    - Server:
      - server_id (The server's local instance ID)
      - server_url (The URL of the server)
      - server_name (The local name of the server as assigned when adding the server)

  The sharing groups can also be addressed by ID or UUID.
- Allow overriding the action names in the stringified restresponse
  messages. [iglocska]

  - for example: 'addOrg' => 'add Organisation to'

New
---
- Mass enable/disable feeds. [iglocska]

  - protecting the sanity of MISP admins since 2012!
- Disable the viewing of a full organisation list by normal users.
  [iglocska]

  - Only site admins and sharing group editors can see organisation lists
    - this includes the org index and various statistics
  - Keep in mind: Sharing group editors CAN see the full organisation list - otherwise they wouldn't be able to create sharing groups.
  - Also, users CAN enumerate organisations that have created ANY data on the instance by looking at the given data
    - this includes events, proposals, discussion entries, etc
- Expose the Sharing Groups to the API, fixes #2767. [iglocska]

  - Add/Edit/Index/View now exposed to the API
  - rework of the sharing group capturing process
  - fix to an issue that could potentially block sharing groups from being synced (the creator org of the sharing group wasn't directly exposed and an edit to the organisation's UUID after creating the SG could make the SG non-syncable)

  - various fixes to edge cases
  - descriptors to the add/edit APIs via restresponse

  - Operation "Just relaxing and looking at stuff for the baby online" - the x-mas covert development patch(tm)
- Limit modules to a single organisation. [iglocska]

    - reworked algorithm to a two phase bulk insertion (validation -> mass insert) instead of looping through all attributes
    - removed the build in counter cache for incrementing attribute counts on events in favour of a more lightweight solution
    - performance gains on test data set: 50+ seconds -> 32 seconds

  - Greatly improved attribute index / attribute search performance
    - fixed an issue that caused the lookup to avoid using indeces
    - performance gains on test data when paginating: 11 seconds -> 1 second
- Add hybrid analysis to the freetext import tool, fixes #2797. [Andras
  Iklody]
- Bump PyMISP. [Raphaël Vinot]
- Show x more attributes collapse toggle on the attribute correlations
  now in brackets so people don't accidentally mix the count up with
  event IDs. [iglocska]

  [iglocska]

  - new upgrade script that purges existing orphaned objects
- Removed debug. [iglocska]
- Clarify scope for filter options in quick search. [iglocska]
- Better attribute add feedback on validation fail and fix to a failing
  attribute index listing for normal users. [iglocska]
- Fixed misaligned org view. [iglocska]
- Fix to invalid role check preventing users from seeing the org index,
  even if they should have access. [iglocska]
- Fixed weird eating of event titles on certain unicode characters.
  [iglocska]

  - substr choked on them and produced empty strings

v2.4.83 (2017-12-06)
--------------------

New
---
- Various improvements to the CSV export. [iglocska]

  - The @FloatingCode and @ilmoka care package
  - Improved CSV performance for instances with large number of events

  - Added attribute tags to the output of the CSV export
- Add restrictions for e-mail addresses to certain domains. [iglocska]
- Add attribute tag filters to the fetchEvents() functionality.
  [iglocska]

  - tag filters now filter on:
    - all events cotaining matching tags on event + attribute level (positive lookup)
    - all events not containing matching tags (negative lookup)
    - filter attributes within a matched event for blocked attributes (negative lookup)

  - moved tag filtering to subquery filtering - should improve performance massively on larger instances when filtering on tags

  - first round of implementations, more on the way
- Various improvements. [iglocska]

  - use the feed uuid caches to link directly to affected MISP events
  - various UI improvements
  - Feed preview pagination / POSTed event ID filters added
- Add the possibility to limit fields for the CSV export via POST
  requests. [iglocska]
- Added mac-address and mac-eui-64 attribute types. [iglocska]
- Added full audit logging to ZMQ and Syslog, fixes #2635. [iglocska]

  - syslog now includes all audit log entries and it's separated into proper severity levels
  - ZMQ logging and syslog logging are both optional features
- Added phone number recognition to the freetext import tool. [iglocska]

  - also, changed the massaging of phone number type attributes to replace 00 with +
- Include user action in zmq. [iglocska]
- Added logging to galaxy attach/detach tasks. [iglocska]
- Push the action for user updates/creations/logins along with the user
  object to the ZMQ channel. [iglocska]

Changes
-------
- Version strings updated. [iglocska]
- Bump PyMISP, again. [Raphaël Vinot]
- Bump PyMISP. [Raphaël Vinot]
- Wip. [chrisr3d]
- Make misp to stix export work with MISP json formatted. [chrisr3d]
- Push MISP json formatted events to the stix exporter (pending rework)
  instead of the direct output of fetchEvents() [iglocska]
- Push the full user object to the ZMQ feed. [iglocska]

Fix
---
- Updated pyMISP recommended version. [iglocska]
- PyMISP updated. [iglocska]
- Removed the requirement for a comment from the import modules.
  [iglocska]

  - if the comment field is set don't override it

- Latest version of the MISP galaxy. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Latest version of MISP objects. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Documentation to enable cortex services. [Raphaël Vinot]
- Don't cull the list of possible models based on existing data for the
  search logs view. [iglocska]

  - slow and useless

  module imports. [iglocska]
- Fixed CSV content type. [iglocska]
- Changed name of export popup. [iglocska]
- Moved attribute_tags in the CSV export to the includeContext flag
  instead of the toggle-able attributes. [iglocska]
- Fixed some issues with the related feeds. [iglocska]
- Fix epic snafu in Event->_add() thanks to last minute save by the
  Travis tests. [iglocska]
- Some minor fixes to the attribute filtering. [iglocska]

  events for sync users, potentially fixes #2653. [iglocska]
- Added new field to MYSQL.sql. [iglocska]
- Added db changes needed for the user domain restrictions along with
  restricting the user self edit action. [iglocska]
- Fixed an issue where proposal quick edits didn't work for normal
  users, fixes #2685. [iglocska]
- Fixed update warninglists button being available to non site admin
  users. [iglocska]

  - functionality was blocked by ACL, but button shouldn't be shown in the first place
- Block the addition of same type/category/value attributes in one shot
  to the same event. [iglocska]

  - via the /events/add api
- Enforce server push rules on a sync user when viewing the events.
  [iglocska]

  - user not seeing the data is a side-effect, not the intended effect
  - serves to enforce the synchronisation rules
  - sync user can still view the hidden attributes via attribute searches etc. Whether we want to remove this in the future is still to be decided, but for now the sync enforcement is the only intended effect.
- Mac-eui-64 not accepted by stix validator. [chrisr3d]

  By the way, it is accepted by the validator at creation..

    - sharing group editor user has to manually add an organisation to the list that has javascript in the org name
    - only vulnerable view is the editor itself, so the impact is limited to
      users that manually add organisations with malicious names to the list themselves / edit such sharing groups

  Fix gpgv2+ key generation
- Fix gpgv2+ key generation. [Phi|eas |ebada]

  This resolves failing of gpgv2 key generation with the following error message:
  ```
  gpg: agent_genkey failed: Permission denied
  Key generation failed: Permission denied
  ```

  # Explanation
  gpgv2's `pinentry-curses` requires access to a current `tty`. If you `su` or `sudo` between users, your tty's permission will stay the same as the initial login user (see illustrating below). You could, in general, work around issues like this by:
   - `old_perms=$(stat -c "%U:%G" $(tty)); chown "www-data:tty" "$(tty)" && { sudo -u www-data gpg --gen-key; chown "${old_perms}" "$(tty)"; }` (uncertain security implications and won't probably work)
   - starting screen/tmux within the newuser and then running `gpg --gen-key`
   - starting a script session

  But first point can't really be recommended, latter two will fail because www-data login shell is `/usr/sbin/nologin`.

  Just for illustrating the problem better for you:
  ```
  ssh alice@somehost:
  stat -c "%U:%G $(tty)" $(tty)
  alice:tty /dev/pts/1
  su - root
  stat -c "%U:%G $(tty)" $(tty)
  alice:tty /dev/pts/1

  - TODO document it
  - new way of handling it, both accept lists with 2 values for ranges
- Added the published flag to restsearch. [Iglocska]

  - allows users to specify whether the events / attributes returned should come from published / unpublished events only. If the parameter is not set both are included

Changes
-------
- Some minor UI changes. [Iglocska]
- Update to gitignore. [Iglocska]
- Version bump. [Iglocska]

  pagination on it. [Iglocska]
- Added more information to the diagnostics download. [Iglocska]
- Allow JSON POSTing to set parameters for the CSV export. [Iglocska]

  - kill the url parameters with fire

Fix
---
- Removed a duplicate ACL entry. [Iglocska]
- Clusters added don't have the exportable field set on the tag and
  because of that they don't show up on the API. [Iglocska]
- Updated to the latest version of PyMISP. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Moved requeue of pull scheduled job to the front. [Iglocska]
- Fixed missing publish flag in restsearch. [Iglocska]

- Added missing dependencies for the index adder. [Iglocska]
- Removed copy paste junk. [Iglocska]
- Update PyMISP. [Raphaël Vinot]

- Fixed an issue where the diagnostics complained about STIX not being
  installed if the stixtest.py was not readable. [Iglocska]
- Removed an accidentally added edit button. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue that incorrectly reported a feed update to have failed
  when not using delta-merge mode. [Iglocska]

  - the issue was that in the case of a feed update to a fixed event without delta merge, MISP tried to insert all parsed attributes, which correctly automatically blocked duplicates
  - however, since these attributes were blocked by the validator, the feed fetcher reported that the fetch didn't succeed as it contained validation errors

  - this fix simply runs non-delta merge mode updates through the comparisons to the existing event, removing duplicates in advance
- Fixed an issue that prevented the feeds from working in CSV mode if no
  value field was set. [Iglocska]
- Removed invalid entry in writeable file diagnostics. [Iglocska]

  a zip file with different files inside. - Changed the file extension
  of Bro export files from ".intel" to ".txt". - Removed the allowNonIDS
  option from the Bro export as it doesn’t make sense to have it (Bro is
  an IDS). - Fixed some of the API endpoints which were not accepted
  (ACL issues). - Added support for a list of events that should be /
  should not be included in the export. - Added a new "meta.desc" column
  (added in Bro 2.5, see

- Fixed annoying capitalisation mess in the event index parameters.
  [Iglocska]

  - just throw everything to lowercase

- Fixed several issues with the import modules. [Iglocska]

  - config settings are not passed correctly to the import modules
  - not having any paste/file upload in an import module would fail

- Fixes an issue where attachments / malware samples were erroneously
  coloured white. [Iglocska]

  - could be reused in the future for similar use-cases
- Fixed a UI issue with proposals and links, fixes #1624. [Iglocska]

  - fixed an issue where link type attribute values were not visible due to links being too similar of a colour to the blue background of attributes with indicators
- Better fix than the previous one. [Iglocska]
- Fixed a potential empty event_id field that blocked new CSV feeds from
  being added. [Iglocska]

Fix
---
- Fixes to the ssdeep detection as it was way too loose. [Iglocska]
- Resolved several issues with error handling in the new feed system.
  [Iglocska]
- Removed already removed file that got reverted. [Iglocska]

  - As first committed by @rotanid
  - The file is not used any longer, however removing it causes issues unless we clean the model cache
  - upgrading to a new version will force the cleaning of the model cache, so it's a great time to finally remove it
- Various fixes to the feed system. [Iglocska]

  - allow users to override the IDS flags and keep all attributes pulled from a freetext feed IDS = off
  - UI changes
  - fix to a bug that caused already deleted attributes to be counted as existing ones

- The JSON schema regarding the related event from Array -> Object.
  [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Left off the actual file affected for the last commit. [Iglocska]
- Fixed a bug with the event view. [Iglocska]

  - the fetcher was moving proposals within an attribute if the proposal was directed at the attribute (correctly)
  - this left the event proposal list in a non progressive array key format, which lead to a weird situation where the JSON format used string numeral keys in a dict as opposed to the desired list. Nobody in their right mind would ever want that.
  - fixed

  displaying. [Iglocska]

  Package object. [Iglocska]
- Several fixes to the STIX export. [Iglocska]

  - based on the findings of @RichieB2B
- Fixed an issue with the restsearch export potentially incorrectly
  loading all eligible events in one go into memory. [Iglocska]
- Fix an issue where duplicates of auth methods in Security.auth keep
  piling up. [Iglocska]

  - due to a bug, each change in the server settings with an auth plugin enabled would reappend the full list of enabled auth plugins to Security.auth
  - this lead to an exponential growth of the number of entries in the array in the config file

  Bell]

  [Iglocska]

Fix
---
- Sharing group edit summary tab issues. [Iglocska]

  - if no external organisations were added it still showed the sentence listing them with the list being empty
- Added salt generation to UserInitShell. [Iglocska]

  - The goal is to be able to issue quick edits to single fields instead of having to include any other fields
  - Permissions are checked before the internal _edit method anyway, this was only used to capture sharing groups
- Publish/Alert responses for API users added. [Iglocska]

- Use php5-redis package instead of pecl for deb7/ubu14. [Andreas
  Ziegler]
- Submodule updates: force overwrite. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Several fixes to the sharing group behavious. [Iglocska]

  - New setting roaming:
    - Until now, users could unselect "Limit instances to which data in this sharing group should be pushed to"
    - This lead to no servers added to the distribution list, and MISP would simply determine, based on the sync rules, whether the host organisation of the remote instance is eligible for the event
    - This works well in most cases, but in some cases, the local instance is not kept after a sync (aliases for the local instance baseurl vs remote instance's view of the url)
    - In these cases the sharing groups ended up being "unlimited", which was not the intent
    - Generally this shouldn't cause any issues as MISP still requires the sync link's organisation to be directly contained in an SG before it would push the event further
    - However, introducing the roaming setting this can be more clearly defined
    - By default, sharing groups are set to non roaming

  - Some further fixes to the sharing group update procedure for 2.4.49

  - Update the roaming status of existing sharing groups. Local sharing groups with no instances attached will become roaming by default, all others are assumed to be non-roaming
- Add own org of sync user to the Sharing group if the sync user is in
  no way contained in the sharing group. [Iglocska]

  - This situation should normally only occur during a pull when the remote end has a sharing group that allows access for all local orgs
- Progress on the sharing group fix for pulled server based sharing
  groups. [Iglocska]
- Cleanup of some messy function call parameters. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue where a MISP.org setting with non alphanumeric
  characters could lead to invalid STIX document generation. [Iglocska]
- Added taxonomies/delete to the ACL component. [Iglocska]
- Added functionality to remove taxonomies, fixes #1365. [Iglocska]
- Allow null values for taxonomies expanded column, fixes #1354.
  [Andreas Ziegler]
- Tightened lookups for the addTag / removeTag APIs. [Iglocska]

  - no longer a substring match, users have to specify the full tag name
- Add perm_delegate to MYSQL.sql. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Remove SET from sql ADD column statement. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Update mysql structure for 2.4.49 updates. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Specify correct&specific branches in .gitmodules. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Additional chars =~ in mail address regex. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Use different variable name in sub-loop. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Check for correct event uuid and id. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Fixed an issue where an event view by a malformed UUID would result in
  a lookup against the leading numerical value in the malformed UUID,
  fixes #1338. [Iglocska]
- Add warninglist tables to MYSQL.sql. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Use same default value as in AppModel update mechanism. [Andreas
  Ziegler]
- Tag keywords in attribute search filter has issues with an empty
  newline, fixes #1330. [Iglocska]
- Fixed leading/trailing white spaces from breaking the quick filter on
  the event index, fixes #1329. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue with an invalid offset in a comparison when adding
  events. [Iglocska]
- Removed duplicate of the same condition. [Iglocska]
- Filtering on attributes in the event view gives a no attributes
  warning if a tab doesn't contain attributes. [Iglocska]

  - Warning now only triggers if the event doesn't have any attributes in any tabs
- Throw exception for malformed xml file. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Set default value for realFileName. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Throw exception if necessary config cant be read. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Fixed two issues for API add event corner cases, fixes #1298.
  [Iglocska]

  - Correctly handle old style creator org fields ("orgc":orgc_string)
  - Correctly handle new tags with no colour set
- Follow up to the previous patch, same thing for log searches.
  [Iglocska]
- Move case statement and add break. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Fixed an issue with org admins having too much access via the logs.
  [Iglocska]
- Organisations updated with no changes cause erroneous log entries,
  fixes #1099. [Iglocska]
- Allow the export of an empty event in MISP JSON/XML format, fixes
  #1295. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue that caused MISP's capture org to disambiguate on the
  name instead of the UUID in some cases. [Iglocska]

  - Due to a fallback mechanism the disambiguation happened on the name if there was no UUID match during the saving of an event instead of creating a new organisation. This was an issue if a remote org changed UUID for example.
- Added domain|ip to the OpenIOC export. [Iglocska]

  - also, the new system should be much easier to extend with new mapping options and is generally a lot cleaner.
  - It would be more complete if Airbus wouldn't have skimped on power outlets on the A380s....
- Rework of the IOC export component, fixes #1292. [Iglocska]
- Ambiguous order field fixed, fixes REST sort of index. Fixes #1266.
  [Iglocska]

  - Fixes an issue where viewing the index of an instance remotely returns no events if sorted on a field.
  - This was caused by some ambiguous field names (such as ID)
  - Fixed by prepending the sorted field name by "Event."
- Fixed an issue with the attribute search incorrectly showing org
  admins the edit button for attributes they don't own, fixes #1278.
  [Iglocska]

  - Also added a way to propose directly from the attribute list / search results
- Empty comments may be added to events #1263. [Iglocska]

  - moved to plain jquery
  - check on back+frontend
  - better responses when adding events
  - fixed an issue with the org_id not being selected for posts
- Fixed a notice error with the attribute pagination. [Iglocska]
- Reverted previous change. [Iglocska]
- Secureauth removed from the config dump. [Iglocska]
- Old upgrade SQL script moved to legacy directory. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Removal of unused file. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Removed the field restrictions from the save() calls in the certauth
  plugin. [Iglocska]

  - apparently cakephp also removes those fields from the beforevalidation hook, meaning that a plugin can potentially escape any data consolidation methods. Not sure if this is intended behaviour by cakephp...
- Fix to an issue with default values not set by the beforeValidate of
  users. [Iglocska]
- Case-insensitive functions calls. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Removed some useless loops, fixes #1231. [Iglocska]
- Reverted the change from addslashes -> escapeshellargs. Will revisit
  the reason it was causing the uploads to fail at a later point in
  time. [Iglocska]
- Multiple values for the restsearch quickfilter added. [Iglocska]
- Proposals now have the correct page title. [Iglocska]

  Casting the sharing_group_id to int value
- Throw exception for sharing group if unauthorised user. [I-am-

  Instead of returning a false value for sharing_group_id, throw an exception if user is not authorised to save modifications to that sharing group.
- Fixing the error caused by a false sharing_group_id. [I-am-Sherlocked]

  If SharingGroup->captureSG returned false indicating it did not save the sharing group, then distribution should be set to 0, and the sharing_group_id to an integer 0.
- Casting the sharing_group_id to int value. [I-am-Sherlocked]

  Saving the sharing_group_id as it is returned by CaptureSG results in Error: [PDOException] SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1366 Incorrect integer value: '' for column 'sharing_group_id' at row 1. Wrapping it in intval will insert the correct int value.

- Allow empty events in pull since they are pushed and importable.
  [Steve Fossen]

  Pulling events from a MISP instance didn't match the events imported from that same MISP instance export, nor did it match events published onto that MISP instance and viewable.

  Events without attributes:
      1) can be pushed
      2) imported
      3) exported

  This fix allows them to be pulled to allow consistency with all other actions.

- Don't query every event for proposals, when you don't have permission

  A little hacky, but without correct permission, the returning null causes the else case ( Fallback for < 2.4.7 instances )  which then queries every event, for proposals which it doesn't have permission for, so wastes resources on both side.

    - taggers can tag events with existing tags
    - tag editors can create / edit / delete tags

    - this was enforced before but the UI elements were present and threw errors

    - all existing tagger roles will automatically become tag editors
    - restricting current roles takes manual admin action, but the functionality should remain unchanged for those that just update

  - still a lot of improvements to be done for the detection mechanism

  - error handling for modules, instead of discarding errors they are now shown as a flash message on the freetext import result screen
- Unpublish event if the published flag is not set during an edit.

- Scheduled push incorrectly used the user e-mail address instead of a
  user object to initiate the sync, fixes #1000. [Iglocska]

v2.4.24 (2016-03-07)
--------------------
- Version bump. [Iglocska]
- Better feedback on the sync connection test. [Iglocska]

  - sync users that have not accepted the terms / have had a password reset initiated were redirected to the login page

  - fixes to the issue
    - if a user with automation/sync access uses the API and gets blocked because the terms weren't accepted or there is a pending password change they will be notified in a JSON/XML response
    - the sync test now takes this into consideration starting with this version and will report the cause of the failure

  - Both instances have to be 2.4.24+ for this to be reported correctly
- More flexibility when editing events via the REST API. [Iglocska]

  - Change the distribution / sharing group with a simple payload

  - Example to change the distribution of an event via the API:
    - POST to /events/edit/event_id
    - payload {"Event":{"distribution": 4, "sharing_group_id":5}}
    - this will change the distribution to the sharing group with ID=5

  - One of the GPG diagnostic checks could run if a previous prerequisite has already failed
- Slightly better error reporting for GPG diagnostic issues. [Iglocska]
- All events quick filter added to event index, fixes #950. [Iglocska]
- Event Tag numbering fixed. [Iglocska]

  - When fetching events, non exportable tags are blocked at a tag level
  - this results in some empty eventTags, which were correctly unset
  - however, this resulted in an associative array instead of an indexed one in the exports

  - fixed by reindexing the eventTags
- If a user is disabled then he should not receive mass admin e-mails.
  [Iglocska]

  - however, if an admin specifically chooses to e-mail him/her it will still work
- Fixed an issue that blocked the editing of attributes in unpublished
  events if the MISP.unpublishedprivate setting was set. [Iglocska]

  event. [Iglocska]
- Version bump. [Iglocska]

- Version bump. [Iglocska]
- Reverted a version fix within the XML file. [Iglocska]

  - needs further fixes, sadly the version has always just showed the major and minor version in the exports
  - This masked an issue that would block the import of events that are even a hotfix away

  - As a temporary fix, I reverted the changes and the XML version field will now only show the major and minor version to restore compatibility (so 2.4.0 instead of 2.4.19)
- Fix to the issues with the proposals. [Iglocska]

  - proposals on REST edit could get added without an event_ID / attached to the incorrect event if certain conditions were met
  - removed proposal from event edit completely, as it goes against the intended functionality of out of bounds proposal management

  - also added an update script that removes the invalid proposals
    - these will automatically be rescyncronised on the next pull/push

  220: + pip install redis
- Major speed boost to the correlation. [Iglocska]

  - it seems that for some reason some conditions in the correlation lookup massacred the performance of the correlation
  - doing that additional filter on a PHP level fixes it for now, but it would be interesting to investigate this further and potentially reuse the findings to improve other queries

  - also fixed an issue with the indexing script failing on some fulltext fields if it has to fall back to regular indeces.
- Reverted the automation change. [Iglocska]

- Entering a valid controller/action and an invalid one produced a
  different result pre-auth. [Iglocska]

-------------------
- Rework of the contributor field, some MYSQL.sql tweaks. [iglocska]

  - added indeces to the MYSQL.sql file

-------------------
- Fixes a bug on invalid event IDs passed to the STIX export causing
  long execution times, fixes #747. [iglocska]

  - Running a stix export for a specific ID that doesn't exist results in a full STIX export for the user (events visible to the user)

  appending all eligible attributes over and over to the file instead of
  properly fetching them event by event resulting in a massive export
  file. [iglocska]
- More graceful handling of pgp errors in the emailer. [iglocska]

  - until now the encryption of emails happened in a try catch block
  - however, crypt_gpg throws a fatal error instead of an exception, killing the background worker

  - added an extra checking algorithm that will test the key for a valid encryption key (encryption enabled + not expired)
  - if it's not there, it will just log an error message and continue execution of the other e-mails
- Event tags correctly saved on rest add if they are set in the
  compressed format (event->tag instead of event->eventtag->tag)
  [iglocska]
- When adding/editing a sync user, the choice to limit a user by
  instance settings shows empty lines for instances without a name.
  [iglocska]

  - use the URL in those cases instead
- Editing an event via REST would not capture the tags. [iglocska]

  - if a user is a tagger the tag should be created (if not existing on the current instance) and added to the event

  - users can now add taxonomy tags separately from normal tags on the event view
  - tag index now shows taxonomy
- Fix to logging causing certain functions to fail on migrated
  installations. [Iglocska]
- Blocked the colour update when the taxonomies are updated. [Iglocska]

  - better to not overwrite the local tag colours unless the tag is refreshed from the taxonomy view. A gree tlp:red looks silly.
- Temporarily re-added org field for jobs. [Iglocska]
- Further work on the taxonomies. [Iglocska]

  - colour coding
  - filters on the index
  - mass tag creation

- First bash at Taxonomies. [iglocska]

  What works:
  - added submodules for taxonomies
  - added import tool for taxonomies
  - added models and convenience functions for taxonomies

  - site admins can update taxonomy libraries
  - list taxonomies / view indvidual ones (with all resolved tags)
  - create tags manually if a taxonomy is enabled
  - view related tags / events quickly from the Taxonomy view

  What doesn't work:
  - Users still cannot choose a tag from taxonomy lists (this will be the main functionality)
  - Feature cannot be disabled
- Update to the gitignore. [iglocska]
- Removed nested gitignores. [iglocska]

  [iglocska]
- Fix to an invalid json request detection leading to the JSON export
  failing. [iglocska]

  - It seems like relying on the Accept header can lead to the data type detection failing when accessing .json extension views
  - this issue seems to have gone unnoticed since until now the data passed to the json view was the same as that passed to the html view
  - this means that all the additional UI only features may have triggered in the background previously on .json views

  #502, fixes #499. [iglocska]

  - this commit is mostly here to capture what was changed in hotfix 2.3.69

  - e-mailing completely reworked, all e-mails now flow through the same method
  - that method will handle all encryption and the decisions whether to send e-mails unencrypted to users without an encryption key, whether to keep the body of the e-mail untruncated, etc
  - all e-mails are now also logged here (including the reason of a potential failure)

  - new server settings for default template messages for password resets / new user welcome messages

  - admin e-mail interface reworked and org admins now also have access to the features

  - password resets / new user for site and org admins (where applicable) - quickly reset the password of a user and alert them using the pre-defined reset template

  =====

  - Tuned the freetext import to really accept free-text. Let me know if you have any tips for tuning the detection further!

  - it now breaks the passed string on whitespace and line-break and tries to resolve the rest. Filename resolution tightened to exclude anthing that starts or ends with a .
- Blackhole message due to csrf replaced with something more obvious,
  fixes #504. [iglocska]

  - user will get an explanation of the csrf error and that going back and refreshing the form will fix it
  - also, there is a link that will take the user to the baseurl (which will redirect to the login page if the csrf issue occured on the login page)
- New emailer finished. [iglocska]
- Further progress. [iglocska]
- Rework of the e-mailing, part 1. [iglocska]

  - Reworking the way e-mails are sent - all of it goes through a centralised e-mail method
  - just pass the recipient, recipient encryption key collection, body, alternate body if the message cannot be encrypted, subject, reply to address and pgp key for reply to along and the method will do the rest

  - encrypt if possible, check if sending without encryption is allowed, signing, adding attachment for reply to encryption key, using alternate sanitised body if it is enforced for accounts that cannot use encryption is all done in one place

  - easy to maintain and expand with future changes (such as the S/MIME pull request on github)

  The contributor field in the event view is evaluated based on proposal log entries from the log table affecting the current event. In order to improve performance, the LIKE check for the event ID is moved to the last argument in order to avoid parsing rows that could be ignored by the other arguments quicker.
- Updated cakephp. [iglocska]
- Fixed broken AJAX queries in MISP as a result to changes in cakephp
  2.4.8+ [iglocska]

  A change in cakephp version 2.4.8+ has resulted in ajax form submitions breaking. Reason for this was a change in the SecurityComponent taking the url specified in the form into account when generating the CSRF tokens.

  This is now fixed by embedding the correct url in the ajax forms.

  	- quickadd of attributes still missing
- Next step in the ajaxification. [iglocska]

- Restricting the event log to show only proposals when selecting the
  contributions of an org. [iglocska]

  - the event changes that a proposal creation creates are also logged (such as disarming the proposal email lock) -> this should not be shown in this log view.

- Fixes with the synchronisation. [iglocska]

  - background pulls fixed
  - now correctly logs changes
  - now correctly updates attributes
- Incremental pull and fixes to pulling shadow attributes. [iglocska]

  - during the event id pull, the local server already checks the timestamps, removing the ids of events that are not newer than the local version
  - this results in only the event metadata being pulled for all events, and the attributes of only those events that need to be updated are pulled resulting in much quicker pulls

  - Fixed an issue with proposals that got pulled not finding the attribute that they are proposals to (for proposals that belong to an attribute)
- Merge branch 'hotfix-2.2.1' [iglocska]

- Merge branch 'develop' [iglocska]
- Minor corrections in the UPGRADE docu. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Clean cache at upgrade. [Christophe Vandeplas]

- Merge branch 'hotfix-2.1.8' into develop. [iglocska]
- Upgrade script for 2.1.8. [iglocska]

  - we have introduced the "locked" flag for events to protect events of the original creator from being edited by a sync user

  - IMPORTANT: before running the script below, make sure to create the locked field for the event table (see INSTALL/LOCKED.sql)

  - This script (generateLocked found in the Administrative tools menu) will attempt to set the locked value for existing events to ease the transition

  - The default value for locked is 0, and all events created on the instance should be set to this value

  - events that were synced from another instance should have their locked value set to 1

  - this script checks for local organisations and sets the locked field to 1 for all events not created by them

  - a local organisation, as defined for the scope of this scrips is: an organisation with at least 2 members or an organisation with a single member that is not a sync user.

  - The script is only accessible by site admins and will return a notification about the number of events altered.

  is case sensitive.

  [iglocska]
- Solves memory exhaustion upon generateCorrelation. [Christophe
  Vandeplas]

- Grouped documentation. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Removed warning message. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Update to the attribute search. [iglocska]

  - Use ! to exclude terms in the value/id/org fields

  - org search works the same way as value / id now, you can enter several
  terms separated by a newline. Also, adding ! infront of a term will
  exclude the organisation from the results

  - sub string search for organisations
- Consistency in MYSQL database file. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Unify db schema. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Filter logic reworked. [iglocska]

  - Affects org and info field

  - terms have to be saparated by pipe (|)

  - terms can be terms that will be OR-d or excluded terms that will be
  AND-ed

  - to exclude a term use !

  - A valid filter search for info would be: 'term1|term2|!term3'
  -> this would result in all events with the info field containing term1
  or term2 but not term3
- NOT filter for orgs on the event index. [iglocska]

  - entering for example '!futuremark' would exclude all events created by
  the organisation 'futuremark'
- Email addresses of event creators visible to users if same org.
  [iglocska]

  - On the event index, users can view the e-mail address of the event
  creator, if the event belongs to their own organisation
- Some fixes to the filters event index. [iglocska]

  - siteadmins can now search the creator org instead of the owner org
  (like normal users would)

  - Changed the org search to be a partial match instead of an exact match
- Two small changes. [Iglocska]

  - email of the user creating an event shown if current user's org ==
    event's orgc

  - on export, the check for to_ids will happen outside of the if branch
    that sets extra restrictions of non site admins. Otherwise site-admins
    would accidentally include attributes that aren't iocs.
- Fix to the filters on IE. [Iglocska]

  - old versions of IE didn't handle an incorrect form creation as gracefully as the other browsers

  - forms should not be created within a table unless it's within a <td> (it was
    on <tr> level before). The normal solution would be to encapsulate the
    entire table in a form, but since we have formlinks for the deletes /
    publishes this would get flagged as form tampering by the security
    components.

  - As a fix, filter forms are created separately for the 4 search fields within their <td> now with hidden fields that keep the persistence of the previously
    entered filter terms
- Incorrect line removed from migration. [iglocska]
- Update to the migration. [iglocska]
- First update to the SQL scripts. [iglocska]

  added an e-mail is sent to all subscribing members of the orgc and the
  new field is set to 1
  - Accepting a change resets the field to 0
- Extra access control restriction for reportValidationIssues.

  from the test environment got left in, caused errors when creating a new
  role.
- Instructions for the upgrade. [iglocska]

  - 1st version
- Update to generateCount. [iglocska]

  - generateCount used to just run through all attributes and save them, to
    generate the count. It led to VERY long execution times on larger
    databases (25k+ attributes). With the extra processing that each save()
    does for attributes, this was horribly slow.

  - new generateCount just saves the events based on the number of
    associated attributes, only having to save the events (of which there
    are considerably less).
- More updates to the migration. [iglocska]

    fetching the info field through a js rest request was annoyingly slow

  - some coding standards
- Attribute and event access. [Andras Iklody]

  - Updated the check for authorisation to view an event and attribute as
    the system hid some valid combinations (such as a server only attribute
    in a higher distribution level event).
- Regexp validation. [Andras Iklody]

  - an invalid regexp entry could block any event/attribute from being
    entered. Introduced a check on regexp entry to block faulty patterns.
- Changes to logs and some minor changes. [Andras Iklody]

  - Regexp, blacklist, roles, whitelists now logged

  - adminCRUD now sets ID (for the logging) on edit

    sanitization isn't needed.
- Tighter checks so users can't edit events of other orgs. [Andras
  Iklody]
- Update to the admin privileges. [Andras Iklody]

  - links now have proper colouring to make the found terms more visible

- Updated the migration script (SQL) [Andras Iklody]

  - Script updated based on the issues during testing

  - Changed the file upload/downoad mechanism.
- Composite type change. [Andras Iklody]

  - composite type's value not exploded if value1 already set (to hopefully
    fix issues with the migration tool)
- Missing migration sql updates. [Andras Iklody]
- Regexp fixed. [Andras Iklody]

  - First version of an SQL upgrade script
- Fixed a minor error. [Andras Iklody]

  - comma at the end of line missing in SQL file
- Changes to the distribution handling of attributes. [Andras Iklody]

  - Only the creating org of the event can change the distribution of
    attributes

  - Attribute distribution setting are only pushed on edits if they were
    manually changed (so that the distribution level of events on the
    creating server doesn't get degraded by an edit and push of the event at
    a synced server when using connected community settings).

  - slight change to the batch attribute search, the search terms are only
    echoed up to 9 terms to prevent the mass echoing of a long list
- Some updates to the migration script. [Andras Iklody]

  - Getting it up to date
- Attribute edit fixed. [Andras Iklody]

  - Editing attributes caused an error because the uuid was not passed back
    from the form (and it is used to find the attribute locally for rest)

  - UUID is now used from the read attribute for non rest users. In the long
    run it would be cleaner to not allow non rest users to reach that part
    of the code.
- Minor changes. [Andras Iklody]

  - some changes to the access control

  - re-renabled regexp and blacklists, will need a closer look though

  - editing a role should update ACL

  - some other minor things
- Previous commit was slightly off. [Andras Iklody]

  Changed the placing of the unset, as it broke the push of attachments.
  Should be fine now.
- Major bug with attributes disappearing during sync. [Andras Iklody]

  Found a bug where an instance that has a lower attribute count pushing to
  another would cause the attributes with equal attribute ID to get
  overwritten with the pushed ones. Unsetting the attribute ID before the
  push fixes this.
- Update to the menu. [Andras Iklody]

  - minor cosmetic change
- Reworked the sync / release control. [Andras Iklody]

  - Fixed issues with the sync
  	- Secondary publishes on remote servers failed
  	- Introduced new fields in events to stop backward traverse of
  	  edit information that lead to low performance and eroneous
  	  distribution information updates when more than 2 servers were
  	  linked
  	- Deletion of an attribute now deletes on remote servers

  - Changes to the event ownership
  	- Original creator org now noted in the event itself
  	- Only original creator org can change distribution
  	- Events will show up with the original creator org for users
  	  (admins can see both that and the owner of the event on the
  	  local instance)
  	- Server.organization now used in junction with the connecting
  	  user's org and the instance's org (from the bootstrap) to
  	  determine distribution flow control and access rights

    (for example for a new instance, or a changed acos / aros table)

  - some minor changes, redirects to the terms page on invalid events
    removed, etc.
- Missing file from the last commit. [Andras Iklody]

  Missed a file from the package
- Fixes to access rights, some sanitization, etc. [Andras Iklody]

  - Admins cannot manually change anyone's authkey, they need to generate a
    new one via the reset link

  - Some pages could be accessed by changing the url - fixed (though needs
    further testing)

  - Edited a change in the manual that may have been confusing

  - Some changes to the way ACL is set up - still needs more work

  1. Some errors fixed in the way redirects worked for org admins

  2. fixed some double sanitization resulting in incorrect characters
  displayed in certain fields

  Hovering over the event IDs now shows the event info in the list generated
  by the search attributes page

  through the URL. Fixed.
- Further changes to org admins. [Andras Iklody]

  org admins can manage their own server connections
  org admins cannot see other orgs' users in the users list
- Issue with uploading attachments fixed. [Andras Iklody]

  Uploading an attachment would fail while trying to set the event to
  unpublished. Fixed.

  Date: Fri, 7 Dec 2012 13:30:10 +0000
  in this there is a complaint about the RESTfull sync workings.
  the email hints about 2 possible options:
  i) RESTfull add event without attributes (conform the web interface)
  ii) RESTfull add event with attributes (more conform the code)

  both are implemented and can be choisen in bootstrap.php by
  Configure::write('CyDefSIG.rest', 'ii') or 'i'.

- SQL. [noud]

  pull-up all changes to the db model,
  so MYSQL.txt has all needed for a clean start db.
- Contact reporter. [noud]

  Submit to org button in the contact reporter view – changed it
  to just submit, having the tickbox to contact a person only + the submit
  to org button seems a bit confusing.
- Distribution. [noud]

  removed No push as a distribution.
- Logout. [noud]

  moved logout from footer right to Global Actions.

- Distribution. [noud]

  border="1"-testleftover removed.
- Distribution. [noud]

  if distribution is All, so not displayed in an index nor in attributes

  let the risk dropdown in event add and edit behave like the other
  dropdowns.

  if that's correct, that was forgotten in the actions_menu.ctp.

- Private. [noud]

  Private events are true private and
  running a server in 2 modes (private and sync),
  so real private (red) or private to server (amber)
  or full distributable (green).

  Mind this needs a change to tables events, attributes and correlation.
  These are in MYSQL.private.sql.
- Merge branch 'master' into develop. [noud]
- Blackhole. [noud]

  i have an idea this blackholeCallback seems to overcome a lot of

  CyDefSIG.showowner=false, to not show email.
  CyDefSIG.sync=false, to not show the text 'private'.*)

  *) note, this does remove List Servers and no sync from NATO
  to MIL.be in functionality besides missing the account so credentials
  there.
- Merge branch 'master' of

  add event and empty info now does not MethodNotAllowedException
  but Flash and show the invalid.
- Sync. [noud]

  small correction after uuid correction,
  so delete attribute works again.

  Vandeplas]
- REST. [noud]

  cURL scripts, used besides example-rest.py to do REST testing.

  get the user and org correct,
  given authkey them are known to the system.

  Vandeplas]

- Fix document-root location (security) [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Database schema. [noud]

  MYSQL.txt is initial schema, so whitelist table must be inhere as well.
- Merge branch 'master' of code.lab.modiss.be:cydefsig. [Andrzej
  Dereszowski]

  Conflicts:
  	app/Controller/Component/NidsExportComponent.php

  Vandeplas]
- Improve accuracy of http hostname detection. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Sync. [noud]

  Database schema updated for sync and re-added event.user_id.
- Sync. [noud]

  Better square and croped images.
- Sync. [noud]

  To test it's handy to run a virtual hosted CyDefSIG having it's own
  database besides an already existing CyDefSIG.
  This is the Apache virtual host setup.
- Sync. [noud]

  Example data describing the NATO CyDefSIG server.
- Sync. [noud]

  The actual logos used for visable flags in Events::index.
- Sync. [noud]

  Sync worked, but we did not know what to do with user_id and org.
  Now, on sync, anonymize the user_id, get the Server.organization and put
  that into Event.org.
  And, display owning flag if Event.user_id or get the Server.logo
  belonging to Event.org (=Server.organization) when Event.user_id is
  empty (=0).

  To this there is organization name and logo in bootstrap and
  other organizations names and logos in Servers.
- Extra bug. [noud]

  Add attribute, do not fill in any, and hit Submit, gives error messages.
- Add attribute. [noud]

  Add attribute, do not fill in any, and hit Submit, did give error
  messages.
- Correlation. [noud]

  do not use the AttributesController::event now,
  just use the old EventsController::view.
- Use DS in stead of '/'. [noud]
- Delete (published) event or attribute. [noud]

  Previous, upon delete only on the local server the event or attribute
  was deleted.
  Now, if delete, look for same event or attribute (using it's uuid)
  and delete on remote servers as well.
  Also look and delete if not published, so no dangling/zombie copies
  remain on remote servers.
- Authkey validation bug and cleanup of fixed bugs list. [noud]
- Authkey validation. [noud]

  An authkey with any length, so less then 40, could be entered.
  Now authkey has to have a length of 40 (or higher).
- HIDS exports sorted (and small indention correction). [noud]
- Whitelist not on NidsExportComponent::urlRule. [noud]

  In hindsight, an url should not be excluded given a host or domain name.
- Correlation speedup using AttributesController i.s.o.
  EventsController. [noud]

  We forgot to change some view things using the right controller.
- REST edit Event implementation. [noud]

  Now after publish, edit and (re)publish an event,
  that event will be updated on the other servers.
- Event.user_id. [noud]

  Event.user_id was re-added but we still missed some,
  so an added event would get user_id set to zero.
  Now Event gets the correct user_id again from
  the person logged in and adding.
  (lateron this must not be used during sync.)
- Whitelist. [noud]

  Mention the whitelist for NDIS export on Export page.
- Whitelist. [noud]

  An admin can maintain a whitelist of host, domain name and ip numbers.
  In the NIDS export lines containing whitelist items are commented out.
- Correlation performance gain. [noud]

  in Config/bootstrap.php add
  Configure::write('CyDefSIG.correlation', 'sql');

  possible values:
  - default, like it was
  - db, correlation in database
  - sql, selection on attributes i.s.o. per attribute
    (sql improvement possible if result conform db above)

  Network activity, ip-src
  30 class-C network ip addresses
  (7650 tupels) (time in ms)

            default     db    sql
  all         25366  16601  15941
              24839  16604  15611
  paginated   16759   8447   6615
              17734   8639   8846

  this is used in both:
  - events/view/<id>
  - attributes/event/<id>
- Bug, unknown server internet name and pull. [noud]
- Fix to pulling from an unknown server. [noud]

  - a server having a non-existing internet name gives
    "php_network_getaddresses:
    getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known"
    on pull.
- Sync Servers, error if server no MISP or non-existing hostname. [noud]
- Sync Servers, fix if server no MISP or non-existing hostname. [noud]

  - a server containing no MISP gives "XML cannot be read." on publish.
  - a server having a non-existing internet name gives
    "php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not
  known" on publish.
- Export HIDS files with MD5 and SHA-1. [noud]
- (Audit) logs. [noud]

  The writing of the log in User was done by me using calls to the PHP db
  driver (during my second or third day). Very wrong given that is driver
  and db dependant. Now use CakePHPs calls to have abstraction.
- GFI Sandbox upload. [noud]

  If add event, give a GFI Sandbox export file upload field option.
  Unzip, read .xml, add attachment malware, created files and ip-dst.
- LogableBehavior. [noud]

  removed some debug() and fixed writing to syslog when deleting event
  with attributes.
- Event.user_id rollback(-part). [noud]
- Loggable behaviour. [noud]

  some merge correction for events and servers, so we log again.
