Cyber security may seem relatively new, but professionals have worked in the field since at least the late 1960s when corporations began adopting mainframe computing into their business models.

Now, everyone who uses a password to access email or social media understands how important computer protection is.
And with the advent of mobile computing, the need for security has expanded exponentially. 
People conduct banking, gaming and many other personal activities on their mobile devices, creating even more opportunities for hackers to gain a foothold. 
There are even remote cyber threats to any device with a computer chip installed. Thus, refrigerators, cars and televisions are vulnerable to attacks.
It may be ridiculous to think of someone hacking an ice maker, but when they disable a fleet of cars, the reality of mobile threats becomes all the more real.

portal is an initiative of Government of India to facilitate victims/complainants to report cyber crime complaints online. 

This portal caters to complaints pertaining to cyber crimes only with special focus on cyber crimes against women and children. 
Complaints reported on this portal are dealt by law enforcement agencies/ police based on the information available in the complaints.
It is imperative to provide correct and accurate details while filing complaint for prompt action.
With the growth of information and communication technology, the
structure and nature of financial services delivery has also changed.
Online banking or internet banking has emerged as a new and
convenient way for using financial services like funds transfer,
viewing account statement, bill payment, use of e-wallets etc.
An upsurge in the use of devices connected with the internet and
the convenience of online financial services has increased the risk
of our hard-earned money being duped by cybercriminals of our
hard-earned money.
No bank or its employees will ever call or email you requesting for your net
banking password, One Time Password (OTP), ATM or phone banking PIN,
CVV number, etc. Such cases should be immediately reported to your
bank.
Always use strong passwords and prefer separate ID/password
combinations for different accounts to prevent anyone from guessing them.
Periodically change passwords of your online banking accounts.
