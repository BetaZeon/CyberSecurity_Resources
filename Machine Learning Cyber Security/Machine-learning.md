MACHINE LEARNING CYBERSECURITY: HOW IT WORKS AND COMPANIES TO KNOW

MALICIOUS HACKS V. MACHINE LEARNING
But in 2018 alone, there were 10.5 billion malware attacks. That's too much volume for humans to handle. Fortunately, machine learning is picking up some slack.  

A subset of artificial intelligence, machine learning uses algorithms born of previous datasets and statistical analysis to make assumptions about a computer's behavior. The computer can then adjust its actions — and even perform functions for which it hasn’t been explicitly programmed.

And it's been a boon to cybersecurity.

With its ability to sort through millions of files and identify potentially hazardous ones, machine learning is increasingly being used to uncover threats and automatically squash them before they can wreak havoc. 

Software from Microsoft reportedly did just that in early 2018. According to the company, cybercrooks used trojan malware in an attempt “to install malicious cryptocurrency miners on hundreds of thousands of computers.” 

The attack was stopped Microsoft's Windows Defender, a software that employs multiple layers of machine learning to identify and block perceived threats. The crypto-miners were shut down almost as soon as they started digging. There are other examples of Microsoft's software catching these attacks early.

The massive French insurance and financial services company AXA IT relies on the cybersecurity firm Darktrace to deal with online threats. And Darktrace relies in part on machine learning to drive its cybersecurity products.

The company's Enterprise Immune System automatically learns how normal network users behave so it can spot potentially dangerous anomalies. Other software then contains in-progress threats. 

“We’re not being attacked by human beings anymore,” Yorck Reuber, CTO of AXA IT North Europe, told Darktrace. “Computers are attacking us, software is attacking us. The only way forward is using artificial intelligence.”

In addition to early threat identification, machine learning is used to scan for network vulnerabilities and automate responses. And in the cybersecurity realm — where a reported one-third of all chief information security officers are totally reliant on AI and unethical hackers are always on the prowl for new ways to exploit security vulnerabilities — that's proving to be a huge plus.

 

Check out these companies that use machine learning to bolster their cybersecurity systems and keep malware at bay.

How it's using machine learning: Microsoft uses its own cybersecurity platform,  Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), for preventative protection, breach detection, automated investigation and response. Windows Defender ATP IS built into Windows 10 devices, automatically updates and employs cloud AI and multiple levels of machine learning algorithms to spot threats.
