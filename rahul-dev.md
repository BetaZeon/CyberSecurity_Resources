Cyber Space

Cyberspace refers to the virtual computer world, and more specifically, an electronic medium that is used to facilitate online communication.
Cyberspace typically involves a large computer network made up of many worldwide computer subnetworks that employ TCP/IP protocol to aid in
communication and data exchange activities.

Cyberspace's core feature is an interactive and virtual environment for a broad range of participants.

In the common IT lexicon, any system that has a significant user base or even a well-designed interface can be thought to be “cyberspace.”
Cyberspace allows users to share information, interact, swap ideas, play games, engage in discussions or social forums, conduct business and create intuitive media, among many other activities.

The term cyberspace was initially introduced by William Gibson in his 1984 book, Neuromancer. 
Gibson criticized the term in later years, calling it “evocative and essentially meaningless.” Nevertheless,
the term is still widely used to describe any facility or feature that is linked to the Internet.
People use the term to describe all sorts of virtual interfaces that create digital realities.
